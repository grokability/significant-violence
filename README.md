This is a simple Laravel 10 app, and its only job is to spit out deprecation warnings.

The index page should link to various examples of 'violence'. Right now we just have two.

I could see us _maybe_ doing some stuff to make the number of deprecation notices being a URL parameter?

But I suspect what we have should be enough for now.
